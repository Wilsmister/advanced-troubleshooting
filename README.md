# advanced-troubleshooting
Expert Troubleshooting documents the most challenging technical and personal problems I’ve encountered—issues with little to no existing solutions. Each entry breaks down the research process, the steps I took, and the reasoning behind my approach.
This repository serves as both a record of my career-long problem-solving journey and a resource for others facing similar rare or complex challenges.
